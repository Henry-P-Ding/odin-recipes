        <p class="description">The Asian steak stir-fry is a delicious blend of savory flavors. Use lean beef to make this meal a quick and healthy option for any day of the week!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 pound beef top sirloin steak boneless, cut 1 inch thick</li>
          <li>4 cups assorted fresh vegetables, such as sugar snap peas, broccoli florets, bell pepper and carrot strips</li>
          <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1/2 cup prepared stir-fry sauce</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper, or to taste</li>
          <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons unsalted dry-roasted peanuts (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Cut beef steak lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips.</li>
          <li>Combine vegetables and 3 tablespoons water in a large nonstick skillet. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Remove vegetables and drain.</li>
          <li>Heat same pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add 1/2 of the beef and 1/2 of the garlic; cook until the outside surface of beef is no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove. Repeat with remaining beef and garlic.</li>
          <li>Return all beef and vegetables to the pan. Add stir-fry sauce and crushed red pepper; heat through. Serve over hot rice. Sprinkle with peanuts, if desired.</li>
